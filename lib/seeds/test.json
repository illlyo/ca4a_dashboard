The College Counselor pushed into English classes with the message to sit for the SAT in March, May and June if possible, sing the March exam as an assessment to identify skills they should focus on in SAT Prep. The SSC will provide waivers for students to take the SAT in May and June. Support and Prep for the SAT is also being provided by IVY KEY and Khan Academy. The SAT Word of the Day has also been implemented as part of the Morning Video Announcements. Will there be a correlation between ELA Regents and SAT test scores?",
